To create a new standard project, type the following command:
```sh
psproject kivy create <ProjectName> -p <path_to_kivy_project>
```

#### example:
If you want to create a Xcode Project named MyProject and your kivy_project folder is relative to current location.
```sh
psproject kivy create MyProject -p kivy_project
```
*if kivy_project is located else where enter full path.*
