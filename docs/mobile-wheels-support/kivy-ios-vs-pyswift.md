## 📦 PySwift-Only Packages

These packages are available in PySwift but don't have kivy-ios recipes:

`aiohttp`, `apsw`, `bcrypt`, `bitarray`, `brotli`, `contourpy`, `coverage`, `cryptography`, `greenlet`, `lru-dict`, `msgpack`, `orjson`, `pendulum`, `pydantic-core`, `pymunk`, `regex`, `sqlalchemy`, `watchdog`, `zeroconf`

---

## Notes

### SDL Libraries
The SDL2 and SDL3 frameworks are bundled into comprehensive wheels:
- `kivy-sdl2` - Includes SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf
- `kivy-sdl3-angle` - Includes SDL3, SDL3_image, SDL3_mixer, SDL3_ttf, ANGLE

### Pure Python Packages
Many pure Python packages (Flask, Jinja2, etc.) can be installed directly via pip on iOS without needing special wheels or recipes.

### System Libraries
Low-level C libraries (OpenSSL, libffi, etc.) are often included as dependencies of higher-level packages and don't need separate wheel distributions.
