## Swift WASM Compilation (MobileWheelsDatabase)

**CRITICAL**: When building Swift WASM packages in `MobileWheelsDatabase/`:

1. **ALWAYS `cd` into the MobileWheelsDatabase directory FIRST**
2. The build.sh script is located at: `MobileWheelsDatabase/build.sh`
3. Correct command sequence:
   ```bash
   cd /Volumes/CodeSSD/GitHub/wiki-source/MobileWheelsDatabase
   ./build.sh
   ```

**DO NOT**:
- Run `./MobileWheelsDatabase/build.sh` from parent directory
- Try to run carton from wrong directory
- Assume current directory is correct

The Swift WASM build REQUIRES being in the Package.swift directory to work correctly.
